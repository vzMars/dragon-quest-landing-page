## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

This website was created using only HTML and CSS. The layout of this site uses flexbox and is fully responsive for different viewport sizes. The layout design was inspired by the design images from https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page and was tweaked to make it my own.

## Optimizations:

I would love to go back and make the design of this landing page more complex and modern. I would also like to experiment more with other CSS features like CSS Grid to compare it with Flexbox. I would also like add JavaScript and incorporate a hamburger style navigation to the mobile layout.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how easy it is to design a website using mobile first since its usually a simple single column layout compared to the desktop layout which is more complex. I’m happy with how close I got the layout to the picture provided by The Odin Project, and I learned more about flexbox.
